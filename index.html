            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Isaac Newton is an English mathematician and scientist popularly known as Father of Classical Physics</p>
            <p>Isaac Newton was born in England on Christmas day, <time datetime="1642-12-25">25<sup>th</sup> December 1642.</time>
            His hometown is Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet in Lincolshire. His father who was also named Isaac Newton,
            died three months before. Sir Isaac Newton was raised by His Mum and step-father, Hannah Ayscough and Reverend Barnabas Smith.
            Newton was born prematuredly and it is actually a miracle that he survived considering that the level of techology back then
            was not capable of supporting the life of a prematured birth.
             </p>
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>Newton attended The King's School for his early school years. After the death of his step-father his mother wanted him to become a farmer,
                which Newton hated with a passion. However, one of the masters in the school, Mr Henry Stokes intervened and was able to persuade the mother in
                sending him back to school. In June 1661, Newton was admitted to Trinity College for higher education on the recommendation of his Uncle Rev. William Asycough
                 who was an alumnus of the college. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree after 4 years and was elected a fellow in 1667. He lived all of his life and works in 
                 the college
            </p>
            <h3>Career and Achievements</h3>
            <p>Newton was a versatile scholar who naturally tend to advance any field he finds interest in as a result, he had works in mathematics, physics, astronomy and even theology.
                Some of His works include:
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Calculus:</b> <br> The advanced branch of mathematics dealing with topics such as "Differential Methods" and Binomial theorem was developed by Newton and published 
                    in his book <i>De analysi per aequationes numero termunorum infinitas</i> in June 1669 by Isaac Barrow</li>
                    <li> <b>Newtonian Telescope</b> <br> In 1668 Newton was able to produce the first reflecting telescope which was based on and as proof to his arguemnt and concept that any refracting telescope would suffer
                    dispersion of light into colors</li>
                    <li> <b>Light Particles</b> <br> In his hypothesis of light, Newton posited the exitence of the ether to transmit forces between particles.
                        He considered light to be made of extremely subtle corpuscles much smaller than those matter is composed of.
                    Though society of scientist then disagreed with this concept and would rather think of light as a wave. In 1704 he published all this in his work titled <i>Opticks</i> </li>

                    <li> <b>Mechanics and Gravitation</b> <br> The famous Newton laws of motion and gravity was postulated in his work <i>Principia</i> which was published on <time datetime="1687-07-05">5<sup>th</sup> July 1687</time>. The laws are also known as
                    the universal laws of motion and law of universal gravitaion </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Death</h3>
            <p>
                Newton died a natural death in his sleep on <time>20<sup>th</sup> March 1727 </time> 
            He never married nor had any child. His estate was divided amongst his extended relatives and family.
            He was made a knight by Queen Anne in 1705, hence his title Sir Isaac Newton
